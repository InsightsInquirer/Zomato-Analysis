# Zomato-Analysis
EDA of Zomato restaurants in Bangalore using functions in Python ( Jupyter Notebook )

This a real time dataset of Zomato App which consists of a list of restaurants in Bangalore with unwanted data.
We develop function to clear the unwanted data from the dataset using python

There are 56255 rows x 13 columns in this dataset

The data cleaning process is done in 7 steps :
Step 1 : Removing unwanted columns
Step 2 : Renaming the columns for easy analysis
Step 3 : Dealing with Null values in every column
Step 4 : Dropping the duplicate values
Step 5 : Removing the irrelevant texts from each column
Step 6 : Checking for unique values and handling the irrelevant ones
Step 7 : Removing the special characters from the dataset

We finally do our analysis using SQL queries.
